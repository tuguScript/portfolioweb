        Hi, I'm Tugi. I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco Bay Area.
        I've always pursued opportunities and challenges that have intrigued me.
        As a web developer, I use my obsessive attention to detail to create
        fast, beautiful, and intuitive websites. Building useful and beautiful
        software products is what gets me out of bed in the morning â€” aside from
        morning workouts and cashew butter.
      </p>
